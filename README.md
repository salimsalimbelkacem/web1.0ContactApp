# web 1.0 contact app
this is a simple hypermedia contact app implemented with `flask`

it is just for a litle bit of fun and learning flask,
it is part of an example project from the 1st part of
[this book](https://hypermedia.systems) about hypermedia web apps
compared to single page apps

the app is not secure or anything I am sure you can add a json element
that is a script tag and basicaly do a xss attack but i mean it doesn't matter really 

it is just here because i wanted to test if i can do it myself without reading
the mini tutorial in the book, the [original code](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/contact-app) 
is probably better than this spaggeti garbage i just did :P

the app can't do these tho hehehe
- Edit the details of a contact
- Delete a contact

i'm too lazy to do them so yeah
